📊 Weather_Report_using_PowerBI
📁 Description:
This project demonstrates how I created a Weather Report Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. The data was imported from an Excel file and visualized through various interactive charts and visuals to showcase trends in temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed for multiple cities.

📌 Steps I Followed:
Opened Power BI Desktop.
Clicked on "Get Data" → "Excel Workbook" and selected the weather dataset file.
Loaded the data into Power BI and reviewed the table structure.
Opened Power Query Editor to:
Rename column headers
Ensure correct data types (date, numbers, text)
Remove any unwanted rows (if needed)
Clicked Close & Apply to load cleaned data into Power BI.
Created the following visuals on the dashboard:
Line Chart: To show temperature trends over time.
Bar Chart: To compare rainfall between cities.
Card Visuals: To display average humidity and wind speed.
Slicers: To filter data by Date and City.
Formatted the dashboard using themes, titles, and layout adjustments.
Saved the file as Weather_Report.pbix.

🧰 Tools Used:
